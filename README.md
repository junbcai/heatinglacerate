# Pedal Lacerate Development 
This repository contains the contents for part of Jun Cai's thesis project relating to _The growth and development of pedal lacerates under different environmental stressors_. 

## Description

This project was piloted by Oregon State undergraduate students as a part of a CURE (Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experience) in Spring of 2022. This project was influenced largely by the work in [Presnell, J.S., Wirsching, E., Weis, V.M. 2022. _Tentacle patterning during Exaiptasia diaphana pedal lacerate development differs between symbiotic and aposymbiotic animals_. PeerJ.](https://peerj.com/articles/12770/) In this study, we aim to characterize the effects of different environmental factors on the development rate (as measured by tentacle growth) of pedal lacerates, the asexual buds of the tropical sea anemone _Exaiptasia diaphana_. This repository contains data from the initial pilot project and follow-up experiments on the subject.
