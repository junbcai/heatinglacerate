## Description

This folder contains all the data: csv files and R-generated tables for the Pedal Lacerate repository

# Experiment 1

Completed in Spring 2022 with students of Z362 Invertebrate Biology. Analyzed the effect of temperature and parental nutrition (feeding regime prior to laceration) on the tentacle growth in pedal lacerates.

# Experiment 2

Completed from July to August 2022 with summer students Kali Sivula, Riley Jones, Kathryn Hampton-Wonder and Sofia Blair on the effect of temperature, symbiotic state and clonal line on the tentacle growth in pedal lacerates and symbiont density.

# Experiment 3

Completed from September to October 2022 with Kali Sivula on the effect of different temperature gradients (27째C, 32째C, 33.5째C, 35째C) on the tentacle growth in pedal lacerates.

# Salinity Experiment

Completed from September to October 2022 with Kali Sivula on the effect of different water salinity on the tentacle growth in pedal lacerates.
